<h4 align='center'> Project Description </h4> 
There are several brain-inspired characteristics that have gained a lot of popularity in the past few years, either due to their ability of performing computations efficiently - spiking neurons, or because of their better performance on tasks - attention mechanism. In the field of computer vision, the way Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) processes the images differs significantly from how a brain process a vision.  We perform an investigative study,  that incorporates brain-inspired features such as i) Attention, ii) Multi-Feature Extraction and iii) Lateral Connections into a CNN architecture and observe the affects of these features on the performance metrics (accuracy) of the architecture on the task of image classification. Experiments show that, brain-inspired characteristics in the architecture lead to improvement in performance on the task of image classification on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 by 1.6% and 3.35% respectively.
