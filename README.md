<h4 align='center'> Project Description </h4> 
There are several brain-inspired characteristics that have gained a lot of popularity in the past few years, either due to their ability of performing computations efficiently - spiking neurons, or because of their better performance on tasks - attention mechanism. In the field of computer vision, the way Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) processes the images differs significantly from how a brain process a vision.  We perform an investigative study,  that incorporates brain-inspired features such as i) Attention, ii) Multi-Feature Extraction and iii) Lateral Connections into a CNN architecture and observe the affects of these features on the performance metrics (accuracy) of the architecture on the task of image classification. Experiments show that, brain-inspired characteristics in the architecture lead to improvement in performance on the task of image classification on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 by 1.6% and 3.35% respectively.

### File Content and Description 
* Baselines.ipynb: Implementation of Baseline Models using Vanilla Finetuning and Transfer Learning on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100
* Attention-CNN.ipynb: Contains code for proposed three self-attention based architectures. Contains heat map generation for error analysis

### How to Run
1) Download the ipynb files from the repository
2) Create a new folder named 'CS591 Final Project - AttentionCNN' on Google Colab (can also have other name for the folder, but then edit the file locations in the Attention-CNN.ipynb)
3) Upload both the notebooks in the parent folder created
4) To get the baseline model's performance run Baselines.ipynb file
5) Run Attention-CNN.ipynb for execution of the proposed architectures on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100
